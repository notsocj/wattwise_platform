## Platform Features & Architecture Overview

### Part 1: Core Web App Features (The User PWA)

#### 1. Unbundled Meralco Billing Engine
- **Description:** Translates raw kWh into exact Philippine Pesos using unbundled Meralco formulas (Generation, Transmission, System Loss) plus the 12% VAT.
- **User Value:** Users see exactly how much their appliance is costing them right now, eliminating "bill shock" at the end of the month.

#### 2. Taglish AI "Tipid" Advisor (OpenAI Powered)
- **Description:** Analyzes aggregated daily usage and delivers hyper-personalized, casual Taglish insights (e.g., Budget "Naku!" Alerts and Weekly "Bida" Recaps).
- **User Value:** Transforms raw data into actionable financial advice that feels like a text message from a friend, increasing user engagement.

#### 3. Live Power Gauge & Analytics Dashboard
- **Description:** Displays real-time telemetry (Watts, Volts, Amps) pulled via Supabase Realtime, alongside historical bar charts for daily and weekly consumption.
- **User Value:** Gives users a visual understanding of their appliance's power draw and historical usage trends.

#### 4. Remote 30A "Kill Switch" (Optimistic UI)
- **Description:** A secure, high-priority toggle on the dashboard that sends an MQTT command to the ESP32-S3 to physically cut power to the plugged-in appliance.
- **User Value:** Allows users to turn off forgotten appliances remotely (e.g., an iron or aircon) from anywhere with an internet connection.

#### 5. Mobile-First Progressive Web App (PWA)
- **Description:** Powered by Serwist, the web app can be installed directly to a user's phone home screen (iOS/Android) without going through the App Store, featuring caching for fast load times even on slow networks.
- **User Value:** Feels exactly like a native mobile app without the overhead of app store deployment.

### Part 2: System-Wide & Hardware Features (The IoT Architecture)

#### 1. Over-Current "Safety Trip" Protection
- **Description:** The hardware autonomously monitors current spikes. If an appliance draws dangerous levels of current, the ESP32-S3 cuts the 30A relay instantly, bypassing the web app entirely, and logs the event to the cloud.
- **System Value:** Prevents electrical fires and protects the hardware, satisfying strict engineering safety standards for the thesis.

#### 2. Aggregated Data Throttling
- **Description:** Instead of hammering the database every second, the system averages telemetry data (e.g., every 1 minute or 1 hour) before inserting it into Supabase.
- **System Value:** Ensures the platform remains fully operational and highly scalable within the 500MB Supabase Free Tier limit.

### Part 3: Super Admin "Mission Control" (Owner Dashboard)

#### 1. Meralco Rate Editor (Global System Variable)
- **Function:** A single form to update the unbundled Meralco rates (Generation, Transmission, System Loss, etc.).
- **Mechanism:** Updates the active row in the `meralco_rates` table. This acts as the single source of truth for all users' cost calculations across the platform.

#### 2. Revenue & Growth (Sales & Adoption)
- **Function:** Tracks total registered users, active devices, and hypothetical MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue).
- **Mechanism:** Counts rows in the `profiles` and `devices` tables grouped by account creation date to generate a 30-day growth chart.

#### 3. OpenAI Usage & Cost Tracker
- **Function:** Monitors the exact token usage and estimated USD cost of your Taglish AI advisor.
- **Mechanism:** Every time an insight is generated, the backend saves the `prompt_tokens` and `completion_tokens` into the `ai_insights` table. The dashboard aggregates these to calculate real-time API costs.

#### 4. Database & System Health (Free Tier Monitor)
- **Function:** Tracks the volume of telemetry data being ingested to ensure you do not hit the Supabase 500MB limit.
- **Mechanism:** Monitors the total row count in the `energy_logs` table and tracks how many ESP32-S3 devices are currently "Online" based on their last ping.

#### 5. Global Energy Analytics (The "Big Picture")
- **Function:** Calculates the total kWh monitored by the entire WattWise platform and the total estimated Pesos saved by all users.
- **Mechanism:** Runs an aggregated sum of all `energy_logs` across the entire database to prove the macro-level impact of your thesis.

## Essential Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `npm run dev` | Start local dev server (http://localhost:3000) with hot reload |
| `npm run build` | Production build; validates TypeScript and runs ESLint |
| `npm run start` | Run production build locally |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint checks; fix issues with `npm run lint -- --fix` |

---

## Project Structure & Conventions

### App Directory (Next.js App Router)
- **`app/layout.tsx`** — Root layout; wraps all pages with global providers (Supabase client, theme, etc.)
- **`app/page.tsx`** — Homepage (`/` route); start editing here for UI changes
- **`app/globals.css`** — Global styles (imported in layout); Tailwind directives go here
- **New pages/routes:** Create folders/files in `app/` following Next.js conventions:
  - `app/dashboard/page.tsx` → `/dashboard` route
  - `app/api/route.ts` → `/api` endpoint
  - `app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` → `/login` route with optional layout grouping

### Code Organization
- **Components:** Place reusable React components in a `components/` directory (create if needed)
- **Utilities:** Helper functions, constants, and services in `lib/` or `utils/` directories
- **API Routes:** Backend logic in `app/api/route.ts` files (Next.js server functions)
- **Styling:** Use Tailwind CSS classes directly in JSX; avoid inline styles unless necessary

### Naming Conventions
- **Page components:** `PascalCase` (e.g., `Dashboard.tsx`)
- **Utility files:** `camelCase` (e.g., `authService.ts`, `formatDate.ts`)
- **Component files:** `PascalCase` (e.g., `Button.tsx`, `DataTable.tsx`)
- **CSS files:** `kebab-case` if custom; prefer Tailwind classes in JSX

## Architecture & Key Patterns

### React Compiler Mode
- **Enabled in `next.config.ts`** — Automatically optimizes component re-renders
- **Benefit:** Reduces need for manual `useMemo`/`useCallback` optimization
- **Best Practice:** Write components naturally; the compiler handles memoization

### Supabase Integration
- Client initializes in `layout.tsx` or a dedicated auth provider
- Use Supabase client for:
  - Real-time subscriptions (`on('*')` listeners)
  - Query data with `.from('table').select()` syntax
  - Handle authentication via `auth.signInWithPassword()`, etc.
- **Security:** Never expose `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` in client code; server-only use in API routes

### Data Visualization
- Use **Recharts** for charts; components are lightweight and responsive
- Common patterns: `LineChart`, `BarChart`, `PieChart` with responsive container

### PWA & Service Workers (via Serwist)
- Configured in `next.config.ts`; provides offline caching and background sync
- Impact on development: Service Workers cache assets aggressively; hard-refresh in dev if needed

### Resource Optimization (Supabase Free Tier)
- **Database Throttling:** Prioritize logic that aggregates hardware data. Avoid frequent, high-volume inserts; prefer batched updates or averaged data points (e.g., 1-minute intervals).
- **Query Efficiency:** Always include `limit()` on fetch requests to prevent over-fetching.
- **Edge Function Usage:** Use Edge Functions for heavy Meralco calculations to keep the database size lean (storing only final results, not raw calculation steps).

## Development Practices

### TypeScript Standards
- **Strict Mode:** All files must pass TypeScript strict checks
- **Type Safety:** Avoid `any` types; use proper interfaces/generics
- **Imports:** Use path aliases (`import { ... } from '@/components/...'`)

### Linting & Code Quality
- Run **ESLint** before committing: `npm run lint`
- Fix auto-fixable issues: `npm run lint -- --fix`
- Linter checks: Next.js web vitals, TypeScript safety, best practices

### Git Workflow
- Feature branches: `feature/feature-name`
- Development branch: `dev` (main integration branch)
- Production branch: `main` (stable releases)
- Commit messages: Descriptive, present tense (e.g., "Add user authentication flow")

### Environment Variables
- Store in `.env.local` (not committed to git)
- Required variables:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` — Supabase project URL
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — Public API key
  - Additional keys as project grows (API endpoints, feature flags, etc.)
- **Note:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` prefix makes variables available to browser; other vars server-only

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Page doesn't update after env var change | `.env.local` requires dev server restart | Stop `npm run dev`, then restart |
| Service Worker caching old assets | Serwist aggressive caching in production | Hard-refresh (Cmd+Shift+R) to clear cache |
| TypeScript build fails unexpectedly | Strict mode catches unused/untyped code | Run `npm run build` locally before push |
| Form state not reactive | Missing `useState` or dependency array | Use proper React hooks; check dependency arrays |
| Supabase queries fail silently | Missing error handling or auth token expired | Add `.catch()` handlers; check console logs |
| Slow initial page load | Over-fetching data or missing route caching | Use Next.js `revalidate` for static generation (`next/cache`) |

---

## Debugging & Troubleshooting

### Dev Server Issues
- **Clear cache:** `rm -rf .next && npm run dev`
- **Hot reload not working:** Ensure file is in watched directory (`app/`, `components/`, etc.)
- **Port conflict (3000 in use):** Change port with `npm run dev -- -p 3001`

### TypeScript Errors at Build
- Run `npm run build` to catch all issues before push
- Check for implicit `any` types or missing type definitions

### Supabase Connection Issues
- Verify `.env.local` has correct `SUPABASE_URL` and `ANON_KEY`
- Check Supabase dashboard for active sessions and rate limits
- Use browser DevTools Network tab to debug API calls

## AI Agent Guidelines

When working on this codebase:

1. **Start with `npm run dev`** to see live changes
2. **Always run `npm run lint`** and **`npm run build`** before marking work complete
3. **Prefer component-driven development:** Extract reusable components early
4. **Use Tailwind CSS utilities** exclusively; avoid custom CSS unless necessary
5. **Type all React props** with TypeScript; use generics for reusable patterns
6. **Handle async/await properly:** Wrap Supabase calls in error boundaries or try-catch
7. **Respect the React Compiler:** Avoid patterns that defeat static analysis (e.g., inline function definitions in props where possible)
8. **Document complex logic:** Add comments for non-obvious Supabase queries or algorithms
9. **Keep env vars organized:** Document all required env vars in a `.env.example` file as project grows
10. **Optimize for Free Tier:** Every database interaction must be "lean." Avoid creating large audit logs or redundant history rows that consume the 500MB storage limit.
11. **Aggressive Caching:** Use SWR or TanStack Query patterns to cache energy data in the browser, reducing the number of direct API calls to Supabase.
12. **Meralco Logic Location:** Ensure all Philippine-specific billing logic (VAT, System Loss, etc.) is modularized so it can be easily moved to a Supabase Edge Function to maintain a single source of truth.
13. **Professional Aesthetic (No Unnecessary Emojis):** Do not use emojis in console logs, terminal output, or UI elements (buttons, labels, headers) unless specifically requested for a "Status Icon" (e.g., a green circle for 'Live'). Keep the interface and logs professional and text-based.
14. **Environment Parity:** If suggesting a port change for development (to avoid conflicts with `wattwise_web`), default to `3001` for the platform while keeping `3000` for the hardware local bridge if necessary.
